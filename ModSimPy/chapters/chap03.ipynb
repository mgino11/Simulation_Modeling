    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we wrote several versions of `bike_to_olin`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We added a parameter, `state`, so we can work with more than one `State` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We added a docstring that explains how to use the function and a comment that explains how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We used a conditional operator, `==`, to check whether a bike is available, in order to avoid negative bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We added a state variable, `wellesley_empty`, to count the number of unhappy customers, which is a metric we'll use to quantify how well the system works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises, you'll update `bike_to_wellesley` the same way and test it by running a simulation."
