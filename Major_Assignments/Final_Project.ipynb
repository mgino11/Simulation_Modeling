    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "[Discrete Event Simulation](\"http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Simulation/Major_Assignments/%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation%22\") has tended to be the domain of specialized products such as Matlab in the past. However, thanks to this simulation class offered in CUNY SPS we had the opportunity to test weather Python had an answer for Discrete Event Simulation as well. Moreover, with the addition of other custom systems we’ve developed generating analyzable operational data. Companies, entrepreneurs, and individuals are always interested in ways to integrate meaningful analyses into their products and or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Event Simulation is a way to model real-life events using statistical functions, typically for queues and resource usage with applications in health care, manufacturing, logistics and others. The end goal is to arrive at key operational metrics such as resource usage and average wait times in order to evaluate various real-life configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SimPy](\"http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Simulation/Major_Assignments/%22https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/%22\") library provides support for describing and running DES models in Python. Unlike other simulation packages, SimPy is not a complete graphical environment for building, executing and reporting upon simulations; however, it does provide the fundamental components, and, as we’ll see in the following sections, it can be connected with familiar Python libraries such as [Matplotlib](\"http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Simulation/Major_Assignments/%22https://matplotlib.org/%22\") and [Tkinter](\"http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Simulation/Major_Assignments/%22https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html%22\") to provide charting and visualization of the process, respectively."

    "### The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently some of the members of my team in architecture and solution engineering at Oracle have been working on a Concept store in Sao Paulo Brazil. Helping them in the development of this project served as inspiration to create a simulation of the daily operation of the store.With the experience of customers becoming increasingly important in the day to day, having a good relationship with them is indispensable. Integrating your solutions in a complete way, investing in technology and making life easier for users are key points to be ready for the future. The Oracle Concept Store was born to redesign this relationship, bringing together the best solutions in technology to bring digital transformation to all the touch points of its operation, integrating fundamental aspects such as phygital, omnichannel, fluidity in the execution of business and an ecosystem of strategic partners.\n",

On a unique journey, our mission is to help retailers drive their business through Oracle solutions enhanced by our partner ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the digital transformation and use of the main technological solutions, the Oracle Concept Store has emerged as an opportunity for expansion and growth of retail, through contributions and changes that positively impact the operations carried out in stores, such as:\n",

    "* application;\n",
    "* gamification;\n",
    "* e-commerce;\n",
    "* virtual reality;\n",
    "* smart devices;\n",
    "* connection with physical stores;checkout in the store, without going through the cashier;\n",
    "* solutions to reward and retain customers."

For those skipping the sellers (online orders pre-purchased or staff with badges), we’ll assume an average walk of 1.5 minutes (normal, μ = 1.5, σ = 0.35)\n",

Also, note the distinction between the two possible queue/seller configurations: although the most prevalent configuration is to have multiple distinct queues that a visitor will select and stay at until they’re served, it has also become more mainstream in retail to see multiple sellers for one single line (e.g., quick checkout lines at general merchandise big box retailers)."

    "Note that we are creating a RealtimeEnvironment which is intended for running a simulation in near real-time, particularly for our intentions of visualizing this as it runs. With the environment set up, we generate our seller and scanner line resources (queues) that we will then in turn pass to our “master event” of the bus arriving. The env.process() command will begin the process as described in the bus_arrival() function depicted below. This function is the top-level event from which all other events are dispatched. It simulates a bus arriving every BUS_ARRIVAL_MEAN minutes with BUS_OCCUPANCY_MEAN people on board and then triggers the selling and scanning processes accordingly."

After 60 minutes, we see the average seller wait was 1.8 minutes and the average scanner wait was 0.1 minutes. From the chart below, we see that the seller time peaks at almost a 6-minute wait."

    "The breadth of mathematical and analytical tools available for Python is formidable, and SimPy rounds out these capabilities to include discrete event simulations as well. Compared to commercially packaged tools such as SIMUL8, the Python approach does leave more to programming. Assembling the simulation logic and building a UI and measurement support from scratch may be clumsy for quick analyses; however, it does provide a lot of flexibility and should be relatively straightforward for anyone already familiar with Python. As demonstrated above, the DES logic provided by SimPy results in clean, easy-to-read code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the Tkinter visualization is the easier of the two demonstrated methods to work with, in particular with Matplotlib support included. The HTML5 canvas approach has been handy for putting together a sharable and interactive visualization; however, its development was non-trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "One improvement that is important to consider when comparing queue configurations is the seller/scanner utilization. Reducing the time in the queues is only one component of the analysis as the percentage of the time that the sellers and scanners are sitting idle should also be considered. Additionally, it would also be interesting to add a probability that accounts for someone choosing not to enter if they see a queue that is too long.\n",
    "Another area that we are interested in exploring is including real-world data into the analysis in order to make the simulations more realistic. For example, a projects developed for both point-of-sale and hand-held scanning systems to be used in a scenario similar to this we could use data generated in those systems to arrive at realistic sale and scan duration distributions."

    "Reduce costs and time to implementation\n",
    "If all the details for a new or changed process are known, then the team can simply follow a few simple steps to assess the cost of implementation. However, a simulation will lead to a finalized plan that will more accurately determine how to bring the proposed changes into the real-world and how to allocate the range of resources that implementation will demand. Moreover, the team will be able to reduce the risk of unexpected challenges, unreasonable downtime, or catastrophic business process interruptions.\n",

Moreover, the team will be able to reduce the risk of unexpected challenges, unreasonable downtime, or catastrophic business process interruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allocate optimal resources\n",
    "Does the team have enough resources – more specifically, time, staff, and money – to be able to evaluate the consequences of every possible parameter change in a business process? The team most likely does not – even if the team did, simulation can help avoid spending ridiculous amounts of money on testing all conceivable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time remains an issue with simulation to some extent (since the team needs to define and test models), but the team won’t need to worry about constrained resources in a simulated environment as much. For example, if the changes to a business process imply the purchase of new hardware, a simulation could facilitate testing the impact of the hardware on operations without actually purchasing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test a wide range of ideas\n",
    "Simulation is flexible and significantly facilitates the testing of a wide range of questions. Simulation can stimulate creativity and “process thinking.” By changing the input data and parameters of a model, the team can quickly assess how it performs under different conditions. Aside from that, business process simulation allows the team to identify and throw away unrealistic, unsustainable ideas and focus on the ones that have real potential to improve the business’s operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess the effects of the changes from real-world data\n",
    "With business process simulation, the team can obtain hard data as to how different scenarios will impact operations. First of all, the team can perform a more reliable and validated cost-benefit analysis. Second, benefits proposed improvements to managers and stakeholders can be more easily demonstrated. Ultimately, business process simulation can prevent organizational hurdles by winning over key decision-makers with demonstrable results."
